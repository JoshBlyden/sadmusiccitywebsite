TikTok and the Trajectory of Music Promotion


When it comes to the music industry, there is no doubt that TikTok has made a huge impact. The app, which was once known as Musical.ly, allows users to create and share short videos of themselves singing or dancing. It has quickly become one of the most popular social media platforms, and musicians have quickly realized its potential for promoting their music. In this article, we will take a look at how TikTok has changed the way artists promote themselves, and discuss some of the pros and cons of using the app to market your music.



One of the biggest changes that TikTok has brought about is the rise of viral challenges. A popular song on TikTok can quickly become a nationwide hit, as users create and share videos using the same sound or dance. This can lead to massive exposure for both the song and the artist, often leading to chart success and even record deals.



 However, it also means that the traditional methods of promoting a song, such as radio play or music videos, are no longer necessary for success.



Another aspect of TikTok that has changed the music promotion game is the way in which artists can directly interact with their fans. Many musicians have found success on the app by posting short clips of themselves singing covers or snippets of their own music, allowing for a more intimate connection with fans.



While TikTok has certainly added a new layer to music promotion, it also raises questions about what this means for the industry as a whole. Are traditional methods of promotion becoming obsolete? How do up-and-coming artists without a strong presence on TikTok stand a chance in the ever-changing music landscape?



One of the top trending singer-songwriters on TikTok right now is 18-year-old Claire Rosinkranz, who has amassed over 3.2 million followers on the platform. She gained attention through her "backyard sessions," where she would perform covers and original songs in her backyard with accompanying visuals from her friends. Her debut single "Backyard Boy" even reached the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.



Another rising star is 19-year-old Conan Gray, who has earned over 2.6 million followers on TikTok through his original songs and covers of popular hits. He recently released his debut album "Kid Krow," which peaked at number 5 on the Billboard 200 chart and received critical acclaim for its honest and emotional lyrics.



Singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo has also found success on TikTok, with her original songs such as "Drivers License" reaching viral fame on the platform before becoming a chart-topping hit. The 18-year-old artist's debut EP "SOUR" debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, solidifying her place as a rising star in the music industry.



Other popular singer-songwriters on TikTok include Madison Beer, Alec Benjamin, Kina Grannis, and Sabrina Carpenter. Each of these artists have gained a devoted following through their original music and covers, with their raw emotion and honest lyrics resonating with audiences.



As more and more listeners turn to TikTok for music discovery, these singer-songwriters are sure to continue their rise in popularity on the platform and beyond.


Only time will tell how TikTok will continue to shape the future of music promotion, but one thing is for sure: the game has definitely been shaken up. As artists and industry professionals, it's important to stay on top of these changes and adapt accordingly. The key, as always, is to find a balance between utilizing new technologies and platforms while still maintaining authenticity and a connection  with fans. Ultimately, it's about finding the right mix of old and new to effectively promote your music and connect with listeners.
