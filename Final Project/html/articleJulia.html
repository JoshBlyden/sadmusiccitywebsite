Resident Julia Michaels: The Grammy Nominated Singer-Songwriter Making Music for Everyone, and now Disney!

If you haven't heard of Julia Michaels yet- you have... but you just might not know it. This singer-songwriter is killing it, as she was just nominated for the brand new Grammy award of Song Writer of the Year, Non Classical. Julia got her start writing songs for other artists, but she soon began to make a name for herself with her own music. Her unique "story-telling" style resonates with so many people- her lyrics are honest and relatable, and her melodies are catchy and timeless. Recently, Julia was selected to write the music for a new disney movie! We can't wait to see what she comes up with. Until then, let's dive into where this Sad Music City Legend came from.



Julia Michaels grew up in Santa Clarita, California with a love for writing and music. At the age of sixteen, she signed her first publishing deal and began writing songs for other artists such as Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Gwen Stefani, and Fifth Harmony. In 2017 Julia burst onto the scene with her debut EP "Nervous System," which featured the platinum certified hit "Issues."



Since then, Julia has had numerous hits as a solo artist, including "What a Time" with Niall Horan, "I Miss You" with Clean Bandit, and "Anxiety" with Selena Gomez. She's also toured with Imagine Dragons and Maroon 5, and performed at the 2018 Grammy Awards.



Now, Julia's talent is being recognized by Disney. She has been selected to write the music for their upcoming live-action film "Queen of the Clouds." This project will surely bring Julia's heartfelt lyrics and catchy melodies to a whole new audience.



It's clear that Julia Michaels is a force to be reckoned with in the music industry. She's crafted meaningful music for everyone, and now she's making her mark on Disney. We can't wait to see what's next for this talented singer-songwriter.



 Keep soaring, Julia!
